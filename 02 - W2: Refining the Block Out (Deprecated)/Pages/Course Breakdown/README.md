# Course Breakdown

<p>This course is divided up into 9 milestones, following the natural progression of building out a scene like this while gradually introducing you to environment creation concepts.</p>

<h2>The Milestones</h2>
<h3><a title="Sprint 1: Gray Boxing &amp; Modularity" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2625" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2625" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 1: Grayboxing and Modularity</a></h3>
<p>This Sprint will cover the theory around grayboxing (creating blockouts) and approaching it with modularity in mind. We'll discuss why you blockout and explore what modular theory means. Then we'll walk through the process of blocking out the street corner and modularizing some of the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>You will create the graybox for your project and get the architecture pieces imported into Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 2: Mid Poly Workflow" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2626" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2626" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 2: Mid Poly Workflow</a></h3>
<p>This Sprint dives into the concept of the mid poly workflow. The theory section has an exercise that you can follow along with as well. Once we get into our project, we'll walk through the process of building out the ramen shop using mid poly techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>You will refine the elements of your scene using the mid poly workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 3: Trim Sheets" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2627" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2627" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 3: Trim Sheets</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;Once we have a good handle on the modeling aspect of our scene, it's time to start thinking about materials. A big part of this will be utilizing trim sheets in our scene. We'll explore a lot of theory behind trim sheets right out the gate. Once we get into our project, we'll plan the trim sheets for our scene and then create our first one. After that, we'll start applying the mid poly workflow to the trim sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>You will plan out and start building any trim sheets needed for your scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 4: Environment Materials" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2628" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2628" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 4: Environment Materials</a></h3>
<p>In this sprint, we're going to explore some more types of materials, including hybrids, atlases, and transparencies. We'll get the doors going, add some windows, and start working out the signs. Of course, we can't forget getting the tileable materials for the scene all set up.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>Mid Poly materials in your scene started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 5: Materials in a Mid Poly Workflow" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2629" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2629" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone<strong> </strong>5: Materials in a Mid Poly Workflow</a></h3>
<p>In this sprint, we're going to continue from the previous with a focus finishing up the materials for the rest of our mid poly elements that have already been built. Then, we're going to start thinking about the mood of the scene and adjust the initial lighting to fit.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>Mid Poly materials in your scene fleshed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 6: Props and Set Dressing" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2630" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2630" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 6: Props and Set Dressing</a></h3>
<p>For this sprint, we're going to start diving into filling out our scene with more props in a process called set dressing. We'll start thinking about how we can use set dressing to tell our visual narrative. In our project, we'll walkthrough turning our graybox version props into real props in a quick and efficient manner, learn about texture set grouping, and plan out additional props to help fill out the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>You will start creating props and set dressing your scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 7: The Texture Machine for Environments" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2631" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2631" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 7: The Texture Machine for Environments</a></h3>
<p>Up to this point, we've had to contend with tiling textures and bland materials to avoid obvious repetition of strong detail in our environments. In this sprint, we're going to explore how we can apply the Texture Machine technique to to environments. We'll learn how to use vertex painting and decals to add variation and gradient to a scene. We'll also explore techniques of using set dressing to help "break up the bland".</p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Project Progress:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">You will start adding vertex painting and decals to your scene to break up the bland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Sprint 8: Lighting and Rendering" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/464/modules/2632" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/464/modules/2632" data-api-returntype="Module">Milestone 8: Lighting and Rendering</a></h3>
<p>Approaching the finish line and with everything modeled, we'll be jumping in and lighting the scene. We'll cover a few techniques for cinematic environment lighting, dive a bit into post processing, and then start to get some final renders.</p>
<p><strong>Project Progress: </strong>You will run a lighting pass on your scene and prepare for final renders.</p>
