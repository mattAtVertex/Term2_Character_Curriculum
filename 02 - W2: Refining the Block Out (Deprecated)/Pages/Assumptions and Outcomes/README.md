<p>Being successful with this course will involve a time commitment. There is a lot of training content and there is also a lot of work.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How Much Time is Needed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Time Per Milestone:</strong> 20+ Hours</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Time Per Milestone:</strong> 30+ Hours</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Breakdown of Time per Milestone</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Scope vs Skill</strong></h4>
<p>How much time is needed is based on your scope vs your skill. To be successful in this course, you will want to keep up. Which means you'll want to realistically be able to accomplish the tasks and assignments for each week. This requires scope management on your part.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time do I have per week to dedicate?</li>
<li>How much work can I get done in 4 hours?</li>
<li>How many hours does it take me to model and texture a single hero prop?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you determine how much work you can realistically accomplish in the time you have available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How Can I Succeed?</strong></h4>
<p>Remember that the most important thing is the work! Pay attention to the concepts, theories, and techniques being taught and remember to appropriately manage your scope! Don't bite off more than you can chew, but be sure to challenge yourself.</p>
