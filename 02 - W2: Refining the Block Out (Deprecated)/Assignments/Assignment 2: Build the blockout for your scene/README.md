<p>In the last milestone, you picked a concept and started on your block out. This milestone we're going to continue refining the block out. You'll start dividing up what can be modular and make sure you get all of your block out pieces modeled. Remember, the more modular you can get, the less work you have to do overall. At the end of this assignment, you should have all of your primary modular graybox pieces in Unreal.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Refine the graybox for your scene</li>
<li>Figure out what pieces can be modular, export them, bring them into Unreal, and assemble (remember, we will be replacing them with final art later, but bringing them in now makes the iteration process easier)</li>
<li>Get a rough idea of how many materials you will need in your scene.</li>
<li>Start applying different materials in your scene to visualize. These could be material blockins or color coded.</li>
</ol>
