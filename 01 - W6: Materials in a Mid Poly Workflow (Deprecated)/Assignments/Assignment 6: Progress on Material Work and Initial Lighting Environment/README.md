<p>In this sprint, we continued building out trim sheet/atlas hybrids for texturing the scene, then topped it off with a basic light environment setup to better judge our textures. Your goal is to finish off as much of the trim/atlas hybrid materials for your scene that you can, and then get your mood set with a basic lighting environment.</p>
