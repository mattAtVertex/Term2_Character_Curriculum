<p>This sprint was a big one, focusing on the magic of trim sheets. For your assignment, it's time to start working out your own trim sheet. Plan it, model it, sculpt it (if needed), texture it, and map it out. Then get it into your main scene. Remember that this trim sheet needs to tile left and right, so don't put in too much crazy detail that might start to make it repetitive.</p>
