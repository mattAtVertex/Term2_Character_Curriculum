<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>What is a "block out"? Let's take a moment to analyze what the blockout phase is and how it is important to an environment artist.</p>

<h2>The Blockout</h2>
<p>&nbsp;The blockout phase is arguably the most important step in the process. This is your opportunity to flesh out the broad strokes of your scene. When building a blockout, it's important to think with a loose and iterative mindset. This is where you will want to try out alternative layouts and make your big changes. Making changes to your broad strokes is quicker and easier here than further down the line. The Blockout phase means building out early versions of your scene using simple shapes so you can make early iterations with little effort. You want to focus on the broad strokes in this phase and gradually work your way down to smaller details through iteration.</p>

<p><em><strong>Key points to remember during the blockout:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li class="responsive-video">Keep it Simple. We're just trying to get the point across</li>
<li class="responsive-video">Experiment Early with Lighting and Mood, but remember it's only a blockout so don't spend too much time here.</li>
<li class="responsive-video">Keep yourself in the iteration mindset, so you can change anything at any moment or even scrap an idea entirely.</li>
<li class="responsive-video">The blockout is about experimentation without heavy investment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Three Keys of Blockout</h2>
<p>When building the blockout, there are 3 key points we need to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Shape Language</li>
<li>Color</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The layout of your scene involves the placement of your assets within the scene. The easy portion to tackle here is the gameplay space. This is important for any game environment. For portfolio pieces, however, you also want to think about how your layout affects composition of your beauty shots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shape Language</h3>
<p>Shape language refers to the shapes of an art piece purposely being used&nbsp; in a way that they tell you a story or set a certain mood. For environments, shape language can be vital to the scene because it gives the opportunity to control the tone of the scene. Silhouette can be a powerful tool in setting the mood and directing attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>The blockout phase a good time to start working in general color schemes. They don't need to be 100% accurate, this is just so you can start to get a feel for how the color language of your scene is going to come together and prepare you for texture work later.</p>
