# Theory: Modularity 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Modular Design. That's something you'll hear a lot in the industry. But what is it exactly? The videos below explore what modular theory is and how you can actually apply it as early as the graybox phase.</p>

<h2 class="responsive-video">Breaking Down Your Scene</h2>
<div class="responsive-video">When working in a modular format, you'll want to break your scene down into modular assets for the major architectural pieces so that you can duplicate and reuse. It's important to think about what these modular pieces are during your blockout phase.&nbsp; The blockout phase is where you want to be making quick iterations and broad stroke changes. When you break these pieces down, you can test them in the blockout and identify potential problems early on before they become too time consuming to handle. As you are building these pieces out, it's very important to remember how modularity works and ensure that your pivot points are in the right place. You want your modular pieces to be able to fit nicely together.</div>

<h2 class="responsive-video">Tile Size</h2>
<p>Tile size is the maximum size that you would want to map your highest resolution texture to on the highest graphics setting. Since most game engines use the metric system and are based on a centimeter unit grid, tile sizes are usually measured in meters. On a console, the max texture resolution would be 2048x2048, whereas on a PC it could be 4096x4096. Defining the tile size will help keep everything consistently scaled and make building a modular kit easier.</p>
<p><em><strong>Common tile sizes depending on genre:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li class="responsive-video">2x2m - common for FPS</li>
<li class="responsive-video">3x3m - common for third person games</li>
<li class="responsive-video">4x4m - common for third person games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Up&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Once you have a strong sense of how your modular pieces fit together, you can start building the pieces up by adding the large details. Keeping in mind that the blockout phase it all about quick iteration, continuously building out these details can eventually lead to the the blockout piece morphing into the final model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>An example of the growth process:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Wall with door hole cut in</li>
<li>Add a simple door frame</li>
<li>Add a plane for a door</li>
<li>Add some trim on the bottom of the wall</li>
<li>Add a door knob to the door</li>
</ol>
<p>From this point, you might start adding more geometry to these blockout pieces until ultimately you have your final model.</p>
