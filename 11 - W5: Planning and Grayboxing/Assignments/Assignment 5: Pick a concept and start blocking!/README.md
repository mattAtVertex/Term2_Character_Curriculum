# Assignment 5: Pick a concept and start blocking!

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do is choose a concept for your environment scene. This is your scene and does not have to be anything like the Ramen Shop project. Find the concept that speaks most to you and gets you excited. You will want to make sure that it gives you the opportunity to explore modularity. But more importantly, you want to make sure the scope is manageable within your timeline.</p>
<p>Next, you'll want to start gathering references for different aspects of your scene. PureRef is a great place to store these.</p>
<p>Finally, jump in and start blocking out your scene!</p>
<p>To reiterate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a concept</li>
<li>Gather refrence</li>
<li>Start blocking out</li>
</ol>
