# Milestone: Substance Designer Foundations

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Welcome to our lesson on creating procedural textures with Substance Designer! In this session, we will explore the powerful capabilities of Substance Designer to craft intricate, high-quality textures through procedural methods. You’ll learn how to leverage the node-based interface to generate textures that are not only highly detailed and customizable but also adaptable to various project needs. By the end of this lesson, you’ll have the skills to create dynamic, reusable textures that can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your 3D models and environments. Let's dive into the world of procedural texture creation and unlock new levels of creativity and efficiency in your workflow!</p>
