<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this video, you get to see a real time example of the different that the layers of set dressing make in a scene. You'll also learn about how you can combine set props into UV packed kits.</p>

<h2>UV Packing for Kits</h2>
<p>When you are building out your set dressing kits, often times many of these models can be UV packed together to use a single texture set. This usually works out for pieces that are likely to be used together in a small area. You want to try to maintain a consistent texel resolution throughout your scene, but sometimes it's useful to be a little loose on that rule with background or small set dressing models for the sake of packing them together. This has huge performance benefits because it reduces the number of textures that need to be loaded into video memory.</p>
