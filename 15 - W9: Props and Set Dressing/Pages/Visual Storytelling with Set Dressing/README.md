<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For this part of the Visual Storytelling conversation, we're going to explore the medium details that tell a story and look at the role set dressing plays in the visual narrative.</p>

<h2>Set Dressing</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Set dressing is an important part of building an environment because it makes the scene feel less empty. Set dressing will make it come across as filled out and lived in. It's also a great way to to tell your visual narrative.</p>
<p>Set dressing involves creating models or decals to help fill out the scene.</p>

<h2>Visual Narrative</h2>
<p>As you are working on set dressing your scene, you want to think about the history of the scene and how everything builds up in layers. This is similar to the thought process you have when texturing a hero prop, but on a larger scale. You want to really think about the passage of time and how the scene as aged through that history. Cause and Effect. Think about the events that have occurred in the scene and each effect it has had on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a fully enclosed environment or is it exposed to nature?</li>
<li>Does the environment have seasons?</li>
<li>Does the environment ever get wet?</li>
<li>Is the environment desolate or does it have a lot of foot traffic?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cause and Effect</h2>
<p>Cause and Effect can help define the story plot within the scene, detailing the history of recent events, and affect the overall emotion of the scene.... all without a word or a character. Including these details in a scene helps with immersion, giving them more context to the world they are playing in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cause - An Event that has happened within the scene</li>
<li>Effect - The result of how that event affected the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Large Effects</h3>
<p>An example of cause and effect in a scene might be walking down a hotel hallway&nbsp; where you notice a door that is cracked open and has damage near the lock. Inside the room, you can see that lamps have been knocked off the bedside tables, the drawers have been pulled out and on the floor, contents spread out. The sheets on the bed are all ruffled. The cabinets are all open and the contents have been pulled out and thrown onto the floor.</p>
<p>What you are seeing is an example of the <strong>Effect</strong>. We can infer that the <strong>Cause</strong> is related to someone breaking into the room and looking for something.</p>
<h3>Smaller Details as Visual Cues</h3>
<p>As you examine the room further, you notice that the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the wind. You pick up on little red dots on the bottom of the curtain and as it blows to the side you see a blood stain on the wall in the shape of a hand. The blood paths along the floor towards the other side of the second bed. You walk over and notice a dead body on the floor.</p>
<p>These smaller effect details act as visual cues to lead you to the next larger Effect. We can then infer that our assailant murdered someone while looking for something, then made a quick escape through the window.</p>
