# Your Project vs Demo Project

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this course, we're going to walk through the process of taking a small environment from blockout to Artstation. Note that this is not a step by step tutorial that will teach you how to make the scene being demonstrated. Rather, this course will cover the common techniques used to create environments like this one.</p>
<p>All of the techniques demonstrated in this course can be applied to many different types of scenes and styles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should choose a project similar in size and scope, but something that speaks to you. You want to choose a project that you can commit to and can reasonably finish within the timeframe of this course. You should aim for completion within 8 weeks.&nbsp; This will allow for overestimation.</p>
