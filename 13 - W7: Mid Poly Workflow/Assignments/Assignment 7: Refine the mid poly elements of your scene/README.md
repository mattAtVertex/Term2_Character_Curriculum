<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>For this milestone, our focus is on refining our blockout further with the <strong>Mid Poly Technique</strong> for scene modeling. You will be finding elements in your scene that you can utilize the mid poly technique with. Remember that we don't need to worry about UVs at this point and we'll be tackling trim in the next milestone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, mid poly means modeling assets that capture the shape and details without the need of a high poly to low poly workflow.</p>
