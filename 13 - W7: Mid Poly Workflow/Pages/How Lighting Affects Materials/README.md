# How Lighting Affects Materials

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As we're building out these materials and textures, it can be really easy to make them unnatural or to overcompensate in the wrong direction that will cause us problems down the road. It's a good idea to set up a neutrally lit scene to check all of your materials against and then make adjustments to the textures as necessary. If we get them looking good in a neutrally lit scene, then it will be much easier to light our scene down the road.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to get familiarized with how physically based materials work and the real world accurate values for various physical materials. This is especially important when dealing with metal!</p>
